# my_kali_install-config
I will save here my install and config of kali in virtualbox

# Installation

I downloaded it from https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines picked virtual box version cause vmware version was causing me troubles with keyboard unrecognition

I just imported it with virtual box and updated the system after startup.
